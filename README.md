```

## How add commands there! ‚≠ê

As the only one person who admin and control the Bot's behavior the way of add commands was changed a lot of times!

since the classic **if(message.content.startsWith(prefix + "ping"))** and being Command Handler! i'll show you how add it!

as a handler commands we should to make this following structure!

```
module.exports = {
   name: "ping",
   category: "subfolder",
   run: async(client, message, args) => {
    //Your command here !
   }
  }
```
Remember define your libs and more to dont get any trouble in the time to add the code!
The **async** method is optional and will be removed if the command do **not** need that function!

**When your command is structured well the console log will display it with an ASCII-TABLE npm**

**example:**

* *well done* loaded ‚úÖ

* *bad done*  Error, check the project and reload ‚ùå
